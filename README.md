# coffee_shop_sales

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive "Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard" built in Power BI, supported by SQL queries for backend insights.  
The goal is to provide actionable business intelligence by analyzing sales, orders, and quantity trends across multiple dimensions (time, location, product category, and customer behavior).  

The dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Track key KPIs (Sales, Orders, Quantity)
- Identify sales patterns and growth trends
- Compare performance across stores
- Make data-driven business decisions

## Problem Statement
The coffee shop chain needs a clear and interactive way to analyze sales performance across different stores, products, and time periods. The objective is to:  

1. Monitor total sales, orders, and quantity sold month-over-month.  
2. Analyze daily and hourly sales patterns.  
3. Understand customer behavior differences between weekdays and weekends.  
4. Identify top-performing products and categories.  
5. Compare performance across different store locations.

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains transaction-level sales records from multiple coffee shop locations.  
Key fields include:  

- `Transaction ID`  
- `Order Date` & `Order Time`  
- `Store Location`  
- `Product Category` & `Product Name`  
- `Quantity Sold`  
- `Total Sales Amount`  

(Data was cleaned and queried in "SQL", then loaded into "Power BI" for interactive reporting.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach & Methodology
1. Data Preparation (SQL)  
   - Cleaned raw transaction data  
   - Aggregated metrics (sales, orders, quantities) at monthly, daily, and hourly levels  
   - Created queries to calculate MoM growth, top products, and trends  

2. Dashboard Development (Power BI) 
   - Imported processed dataset  
   - Created DAX measures for KPIs  
   - Designed interactive visuals mapped to business requirements  
   - Added slicers for month selection and store filtering
